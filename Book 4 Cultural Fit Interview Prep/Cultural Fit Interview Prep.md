# Cultural Fit Interview Prep

While having the required technical skills to complete a job are important, perhaps more importantly is fit. Are you a good fit for the company’s culture? The best way for companies to gauge this is by asking behavioral questions. Here at NewForce, because you will be preparing for technical interviews too, we call this step in the interview process the cultural interview. Others might call it a behavioral or soft skills interview. Here are some tips for preparing. You will also be learning the STAR interview technique.
Tips for Interviewing: 

**Be Honest** <br>Focus on telling real stories, and tie those stories back to what the company is looking for in an employee. If you do that, you don’t have to be perfect. No one expects you to be perfect. They want to see that you’re a human they want to work with.

**Sell Yourself** <br>One place where you may be underselling yourself inadvertently is when speaking about work that you did as part of a team. Yes, the fact that you worked with a team is important, but it’s also critical to specifically highlight your own accomplishments. Say “I” not “we” when talking about what you did.

**Think of this as a conversation** <br>Meaning make sure you truly listen to the interviewers and answer appropriately, don’t assume you know the answer they are going to askIt should feel conversational, too, meaning you can ask clarifying questions if you didn’t understand what they asked and think about answering like you would if you were telling a non-technical friend of yours about your experience in NewForceWhen asking questions at the end, listen to their answers before jumping right into your next prepared questionAssume they’ve just *glanced* at your resume

**Lean on stories; especially from NewForce projects** <br>**TEAMWORK:** How do you work within a team? <br>**PASSION:** Are you *interested* in development and care enough about it to keep learning at a fast pace? <br>**CURIOSITY:** What most interests you about software development? What do you find yourself thinking about in your time away from NewForce? <br>**BEING NICE:** Are you someone they want to work with?
