# STAR Interview Technique 

The STAR Technique allows you to fully answer questions with structure and clarity. It’s so easy to ramble when you’re asked a question in an interview. STAR will prevent rambling and give you focus.

**Situation**: Describe the event or situation that you were in

**Task**: Explain the task you had to complete

**Action**: Describe the specific action you took to complete the task. What did you (not your team) decide to do? What steps did you take to address the situation? Focus on your actions, while being humble, and acknowledging the accomplishments of your team. 

**Result**: Close with the result of your actions

**Examples:**

Give an example of how you set a goal either for yourself or with a team. How did you achieve it?** 

**S.** While studying at Newforce, we were fortunate enough to have worked on several group projects together. One specific project that we worked on in teams was called Trestlebridge Farms and it was the first C# project assigned to our group.
**T.**  The project included a lot of starter code, so it was essentially like we were picking up the project from where another team off. So, apart from building this application as a team, we also had to understand the code that was already written and how exactly we needed to finish it. 
**A.** As a team, we decided to focus on spending the bulk of our time in the planning phase where we walked through the existing code, our conceptual understanding of the project, and how we needed to divide our tasks to make it a cohesive and productive process**.**
**R.** Because we spent so much time as a team figuring out our tasks together, we experienced a smooth-sailing, timely, and stress free group project where we were able to efficiently work together to deliver the assigned product.

**Describe a situation in which you met a roadblock. How did you deal with it?** 

**S.** A couple years ago, while I was in college, I attended a hackathon, called Technica, which is an all-female hackathon that invites women in software related fields to mentor the young women that come to participate in the hackathon. It was a cool opportunity where we could interact with representatives from places like Facebook, NSA, CIA, and Fannie Mae, who had booths set up. Even though I didn’t have a coding or software background at this point, it was really amazing to me to be able to interact these awesome women with really cool careers
**T.**  I was given coding challenges throughout the 24hr hackathon - There were also workshops - intro to coding languages. I realized I did not have the coding experience to code some of the challenges. 
**A.** Instead of feeling defeated or quitting, I refocused my goals away from completing coding challenges. Absorb as much info as possible from the workshops
**R.** I gained more exposure than I would have anywhere else.
