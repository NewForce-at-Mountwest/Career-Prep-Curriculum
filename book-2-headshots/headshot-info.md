Do not put your headshot on your resume. Why? When hiring, recruiters are trained to remain bias-free, and sending a resume with a picture of you compromises this. Some companies will throw out all resumes with photos to ensure a fair hiring process. A headshot will also detract from your listed experience. If they want to know more about you, they can visit your LinkedIn profile on your resume. If that weren’t enough, headshots aren’t ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly, so your resume could be booted for including a picture. More on the evil ATS later.
