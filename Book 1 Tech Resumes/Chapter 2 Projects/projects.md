# Projects

Employers want to see the projects you’ve created. They want to know why and how you built projects. In this section, two projects should be listed. When you begin working on your resume, you will add group projects such as Bangazon and Nutshell. As you move forward in the classroom curriculum, you will want to trade these out for your capstone projects. 

### Examples:

#### Nutshell

*Include GitHub Link*

Nutshell is an all-in-one social media platform built in two consecutive week-long sprints. Users can log into Nutshell and interact with their news feed, to-do list, and chatroom. I was responsible for building the **INSERT WHAT YOU BUILT** components. In the first sprint, we built Nutshell using vanilla JavaScript. In the second sprint, we refactored the same application into React. Both apps used json-server, a mock RESTful API, for persistent storage. 

#### Bangazon API 

*Include GitHub Link* 

The Bangazon API is a RESTful API built for our mock company, Bangazon. We designed a data structure based on complex business logic and built an ASP.NET Web API to give users access to resources in the company’s database. I worked on the **INSERT WHAT YOU BUILT** resources. Each end point in our API is fully covered with integration tests. Built with ASP.NET and ADO.NET to interface with a SQL Server database.

### How do I write my project description?  

First, you want to describe why there was a need for this project, which can be a personal need. 

- What problem does your app solve?
- How does your app solve that problem?
- What features are included in your app?
- What technologies did you use?

### Additional Examples

**Bots Against Humanity** 

This is an application that closely resembles the game *Cards Against Humanity* except that there are three robots that answer question prompts as opposed to human players. The user gets to vote on the funniest combination of cards and enjoy the chaotic phrases the bots put together. By voting on cards, users can gain points and purchase more card decks that can be used to diversify the selection of answer cards the robots can draw from. I wanted to build this application because it seemed like a great way to entertain yourself while still maintaining the integrity of humor from the original card game. This application was built with C#/.NET and Entity Framework and the user interface is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

**Daily Drishti** 

This app is for people who are looking to become better organized in accomplishing their health and wellness goals. It is hard to remember to do all of the little things right everyday, let alone to remember what the “little things” are. This app prompts the user with various daily tasks, that through various research and readings, have been deemed positive action. When done with consistency, the tasks lead to a happier and healthier life. This app was built with React and styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.

**Accrual World** 

This MVC web application allows independent contractors to track expenses and payments for tax purposes. The user can perform CRUD tasks on expenses and income as well as store and display uploaded files consisting of receipts and invoices. The user can print invoices and receipts in the event of an audit by the IRS. The user can view and compare income and expenses over time in graphs, charts, and several calculations automatically. This app was built in C#/.NET and uses ASP.NET and SQL to interface with the database.
