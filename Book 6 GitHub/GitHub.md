# GitHub

GitHub lets employers look at your code and clone down your projects. Think of this as your online portfolio. Employers will look at your pinned repositories on the front page. They'll look at your README first, so make sure that you have a clear and engaging README for any pinned repo. If they read your code, they'll probably scan for clear naming conventions and comments. It's important to make sure that both capstone projects-- and any other projects you're proud of-- are pinned and presentable. Here are your steps, in order of priority:

## Profile Picture
- [ ] Use your headshot

## Pin Your Best Projects
- [ ] You should have both of your capstone projects pinned
- [ ] You should also pin any side projects you've worked on
- [ ] If you're particularly proud of any group projects you were part of, fork them to your profile and then pin those too
- [ ] Any pinned projects should have solid, descriptive READMEs (see below!)

## README Files
This will be the first thing employer's look at and potentially the only thing they look at. In general, README's should be written in very easy to understand language. No big words, no fancy terminology. It should be as easy to read as you can possibly make it so that people can focus on your awesome app. Your README should have:
  - [ ] An overview of what your app does and why you built it, written in plain non-technical language
  - [ ] A link to your deployed app, if you deploy it
  - [ ] A walkthrough of your app's features (Screenshots are a cool bonus, but not necessary)
  - [ ] Grandma-proof instructions for cloning and running your app
  - [ ] A list of libraries or external tools you used with hyperlinks
  - [ ] Here are some examples of stellar, above-and-beyond README's:
    - [ ] [Ricky Bruner - Pantry Perfect](https://github.com/ricky-bruner/Pantry-Perfect-Midstone)
    - [ ] [Eli Wilson - Game Galaxy](https://github.com/e-x-wilson/game-galaxy)
    - [ ] [Jenn Lawson - SpecTrek](https://github.com/Crashofthemoons/SpecTrek)

 ## Repos
 - [ ] Delete any empty repos
 - [ ] if you have some code that belongs in them and never got pushed up, push it up.
 - [ ] Your repos should have descriptive, professional-sounding names. For example, if you have a repo on your GitHub account called stuff or what-is-going-on, you should rename it.
 - [ ] Go back and check for any old repos named "Java functions", "Java loops", etc when we were learning JavaScript. Rename them to JavaScript. Java is a different language and we don't want to confuse anybody.

## Capstone Code
Make sure to clean up your capstone code. This is not your first priority, but it's a good idea to do this before you go on a technical interview.
  - [ ] You should not have any commented out code on your master branch (Descriptive comments are great, though!)
  - [ ] You should not have any console.log()s or debugger statements on your master branch
  - [ ] Your variable names should be descriptive and professional. If you have variables named thing and stuff, change them

## Old Exercises
 - [ ] You don't have to delete your old exercises. Employers might want to see how far you've come. If you have time and feel the urge, a super A+ GitHub move would be to add README.md files to your exercises explaining what the assignment was and what you learned from it. (But bear in mind that this is way above and beyond. Most employers will probably only look at your pinned repositories. This should be your last priority.)
