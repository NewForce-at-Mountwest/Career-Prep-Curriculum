# Questions to Definitely Prepare

**“Tell me about yourself.”**<br> This question typically comes at the very beginning. This is the perfect opportunity to ease into the interview, so make sure you’re prepared for this one. You don’t want to just rundown your resume and you also want to avoid rambling. While this shouldn’t sound memorized, this is a question you know you’re likely going to get, so be prepared. Here are a few examples that show a balance between accomplishments and personal life:

*I was born and raised in Kentucky. I come from a family with limited education; my mother only completed 8th grade and my dad 5th grade which meant I was often self-taught. Once I started school, I might be a little shy, but I found that I loved to learn. At a young age, I was interested in computers; my uncle gave me a commodore ‘64. I also loved helping to troubleshoot anything computer related at my parents’ grocery store. When I graduated from high school I began studying nursing. I missed the tech world and shifted. Eventually, I started studying IT, which I loved. I graduated in 2018. Again, I love learning, so I applied for NewForce and I’m excited about my next chapter.*

*I was born and raised in Clendenin, WV. I have a beautiful family including twins and a wonderful wife. I love working on my farm which includes almost 30 animals, I have some hobbies I’m passionate about including... I’ve always loved schooling, and I’ve held a variety of jobs including 8 years at the state where I was introduced to computer programming. I was ready to learn more about coding which led me to NewForce.*

**“What is a strength and a weakness?”**<br>Self-assessment is a vital skill employers look for when hiring. 

When defining a strength, make sure you’re honest. In addition to honesty, can you find a strength that directly relates to this job posting? For example, if you’re applying for a job that requires you to be hyper-organized, and you have both experience and a love of this, say that is one of your biggest strengths! 

Let’s talk about weaknesses; we all have them. Again, it’s about self-assessment, so make sure you can articulate a weakness of yours. NEVER say you don’t have a weakness. Also, don’t say my weakness is actually my biggest strength. Michael Scott said that. Don’t say that. It’s okay to have a weakness! Employers worry if a candidate can’t identify this because it indicates two things: you can’t self-assess and you are unwilling to grow as an employee. 

When picking a weakness, try to avoid one that’s required in the job description. Once you’ve identified a weakness, answer using the following formula:<br> ***Name the weakness + give an example + talk about the steps you’re taking to improve***

Don’t present your weakness as though you’ve fully solved it. That’s not the point of this question. Show them you’re capable of solving problems and growing from them. 

**“Why are you interested in this role?” Or “Why do you want to work for our company?”**<br>This is a great time to show that you’ve done some research about the role and the company. You also should, as always, be as truthful as possible. Why *do* you want this role? (“I need a job,” might be the honest answer, but is there any reason you want this job specifically?) For example, if you’re interviewing for a front end role and you liked working with React, you could say:

*I’ve had some experience at NewForce working with React, and I really loved learning how frameworks like React work under the hood. I’m excited to keep learning and grow my skills as a front-end dev while helping clients.*

Or, if you’re interviewing for a company where you have some kind of related or adjacent experience, you could say:

*I’ve worked in warehouses and shipping departments before, so I can relate to the people who use your software and I know how important it is to have efficient and user-friendly applications for warehouses. I’m excited to have a chance to make the warehouse staff’s lives a little easier.*

If you can’t think of a specific reason to be excited about this specific job, you can always say something generic like: 

*I’m really excited to keep learning and growing as a software developer and this seems like a role where I could be part of a great team and learn X, Y, and Z.*

In general, pick 3 to 4 contrete reasons you'd like to work for that company. Pull examples from either the job description or from the website. 



Example:

**Why do you want to work for Claris Health?**

I want to work for Claris Health because I really admire the way that your company identified and addressed an important and relevant problem in today’s healthcare industry. The technology at Claris Health is designed to reach and help more people by imbuing them with a sense of security and trust in this software. I just really really appreciate how there is a visible effort to meet and understand users needs at your company. Moreover, I would love to work for a company that has teams that prioritize learning and mentoring each other, which is something I picked up while reading the job description so I look forward to hearing more about your software development team.

**“Do you have any questions for me?”** 

This is how every interview ends so be prepared with a few questions for them to learn a little more about the company. If you have questions about the job posting, that is the time to ask them. Asking questions shows the company that you are truly interested in joining their team. **Always have 2-3 questions prepared.** This is **not** the time to talk about salary or benefits. More on that below. In the meantime, here are a few solid questions to ask:

- Can you tell me a bit about your background and why you wanted to join this company?

- What projects have you enjoyed working on most? Why?

- What does your onboarding process look like?

- What does the first month look like for a new employee? Third? A year?

- What opportunities are there for growth and personal development? Have you taken advantage of any of these opportunities?

- What makes an employee successful at your company?

- What’s your favorite part of your job?

- What’s your code review process? 

- Is there anything I haven’t addressed that you would like to know more about? 

- How is the software development team at your company structured? How much interaction does the team have with other departments at your company?

- What do you think will be some of the challenges for someone in this role?

  **Have you ever been fired?**

  Life happens. Sometimes we take a new job, and we discover we’re not a great fit. Sometimes we’ve been in a job for a while, and grow in a different direction. Sometimes the company is at fault. Sometimes we are at fault. No matter the reason, it’s important to take responsibility for the situation, and frame it in a positive way where we show we’ve learned from the experience. We don’t ever want to play the blame game because that will show potential employers that’s how you handle tough situations, which is no good.
  [Workitdaily.com](https://www.workitdaily.com/behavioral-interview-question-examples) practices a great formula when answering this question:

  ***Your experience + what you learned from it = how you grew from this opportunity***

  **What if they ask me a question I don’t know the answer to?**

  Be honest and then reframe! *While I’m not entirely sure, I know that I can search for the answer….One example of how I’ve done this in the past was when I was working on a project with a team at NewForce…*A great software development reframe is: I can learn independently, and I know where to find answers to learn more
