# Cover Letters

A cover letter is the perfect way to introduce yourself and leave an impression. This one-page letter provides a brief overview of your experience that directly relates to the job you’re applying for. While cover letters won’t always be required, it’s important to be prepared. Also, if an application doesn’t require a cover letter, you’ll want to have a smaller version of a cover letter in the body of email applications to offer a more personal touch and genuine interest in the position you’re applying for.
