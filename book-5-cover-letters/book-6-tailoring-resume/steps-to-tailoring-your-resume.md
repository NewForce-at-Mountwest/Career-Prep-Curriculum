## Steps To Tailoring Your Resume: 

1. Copy and paste job description into a doc

2. Read through the entire job description and highlight anything that you’ve done before, either at NewForce or during your previous work experience

3. Take keywords from the highlighted bullet point, and write a bullet point for your resume, incorporating those keywords. 

   ​	For example:
   ​		**Original bullet point from the job description:**<br>		Proficiency with Microsoft Office, Google’s G suite and Salesforce or other CRM tools

   ​		**Tailored bullet point to add to your resume:**<br>		Job 1: Utilized both Microsoft Office and Google’s G Suite regularly<br>		Job 2: Operated company’s CRM daily to track detailed client information 

   ​		:no_entry_sign: *Note: Avoid directly copying the original bullet point* :no_entry_sign: 

4. After you’ve highlighted and rewritten all of the relevant bullet points in your doc, open your Canva resume

5. Click FILE, scroll down and click MAKE A COPY

6. Once you’ve created a new copy of your resume, close the original resume so you don’t accidentally edit that one

7. Rename the copy of your resume to read YOUR NAME THE COMPANY Resume 

   ​		For example: <br> 		**Mia Spurlock The Pawffice of Barkington Resume**

8. Add or tailor current bullet points in Canva from the job description doc. If you don’t have enough space, look for bullet points that aren’t as relevant and delete them for this application.
