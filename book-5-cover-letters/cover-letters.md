# Cover Letters

**Company Research**

First, you’ll want to research the company:<br>**General Information About the Company**<br>

- What do they do? What’s their product?

- Who do they serve? 

- Who is on their team? What are their backgrounds?

- What can you learn about their culture? *Why* do they do what they do? *How* do they do it?

- Based on all of the above, why are you interested in working with them? Are you interested in the work they’re doing or are you interested in joining the team of people? This is what you’ll want to include in your cover letter!

- Name of Hiring Manager or Name of Contact (often listed on the job posting) Do they list a specific contact person? If so, address your cover letter to them!

- What are the keywords they list in the job description that are related to your experience? Specific languages? Do they mention teamwork? 

  **General Outline/Template:**
  **Greeting: **

  **Make it PERSONAL**Make sure to address your cover letter to a specific person if at all possible instead of using “Dear Hiring Committee'', for example. If the job posting lists a hiring manager, address it to them. If the job description doesn’t include a name, do some digging on their website to see if they list someone in HR or if it's a small company, feel free to address it to leadership, like their CEO. It shows you took the extra few minutes to personalize this letter to this opportunity and this company!
  **Paragraph 1: The WHY** 

  Start out your letter with why you are excited about this company. Avoid the usual “I saw your posting on Indeed and wanted to apply.” Instead, your first sentence should tell the employer why you want to work for them. Check out the Stackflow blog example below for a good sample. Questions to consider:Is there anything in your background that connects you directly with this company? If so, include that.What excites you most about this role?Have you heard good things about the company from a peer?Were you recommended to apply by someone? If so, mention their name and where you met!
  **Paragraph 2 and 3: **

  **Why you can DO the job? CONNECT your experience to the job**This is your opportunity to really talk about why you could DO the job. If the first paragraph was why the company, this second paragraph should be why you. Look at the job description. Highlight keywords that jump out: do they mention teamwork? Specific languages? Think of the job description keywords as your checklist and try to touch on as many items as you can with specific examples from your background.

  Start with describing your story *before* NewForce, what brought you to the program, what did you do before the program. Make sure to highlight parts of your experience that relates to the job description. 

  Then, talk about NewForce, what you’re learning through this program that’s relevant to this job. Talk about your project(s) here, highlighting the technologies they outline in the job description and how you went about developing the app. An effective cover letter is one that **describes** your experiences. Example: “In this project I learn how to write code efficiently in a team...”
  **Closing**
  This can be simple. First, start with a summary of why you’re a good fit for this job, using the themes you’ve drawn out in each of the above paragraphs. So something like, “I’d love to bring my passion for software development and ability to work with teams to *Example Company* as a junior developer.” Make sure to include the company name and job title here.

  **General Tips:**

  1. Show your enthusiasm. Use phrases like “I’m excited to...” and “I’ve most enjoyed...” and “My favorite part of…”
  2. Look for keywords and phrases in the job description and include those throughout
  3. Try to match the tone and culture of the company’s website: are they formal? Informal? Fun? professional?

  **Formatting Tips:**

  1. It doesn’t have to be long or even super formal! Personal, clear, and relevant is way more important than long!
  2. Always send as a pdf -- not a word doc
  3. Keep it simple! No fancy formatting needed. Use the same heading on your Canva resume for your cover letter
