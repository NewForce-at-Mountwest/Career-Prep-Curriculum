# SENDING EMAILS TO EMPLOYERS AND RECRUITERS

**Subject Line**<br>Check the job posting for application instructions and follow those. Sometimes they ask you to apply with a specific subject line. If you only find an email to send your materials to, keep your subject line simple and clear. For example: *Software Developer II - Jennifer Johnson Application*. Something along those lines will help recruiters and employers know exactly what you’re applying for. 

**Email with Resume and Cover Letter Attached**<br>Just like your cover letter, make sure your greeting is to a specific person. If the job posting asked for a cover letter to be attached, your email will be a mini cover letter. Make sure to include who you are, what you’re applying for, and why you would be a good fit. Also include that you have attached documents.

**Email with Resume attached**<br>If they do not ask for you to submit a cover letter, use the body of the email to include most of the information from your cover letter. Don’t attach documents they didn’t ask for. 

**Attached Materials** <br>There’s nothing worse than spending hours on a beautiful resume only to find that the company couldn’t open it, or if they did, it was all scrambled. Make sure all of your attached materials are sent as PDFs, not word documents. PDFs are a guarantee that the other party can see your resume as you intended them to see it. 
Make sure to clearly name your documents so there isn’t any confusion as to what is attached. While it might be clear in your email, if recruiters or employers download your files onto their computer, they will need as much clarity as possible. 

Example: 	Jennifer Smith Resume - Claris Health 	Jennifer Smith Cover Letter - Claris Health 

**Email a Thank You**<br>After you’ve interviewed with a company, send a brief follow up email that day or the day after thanking them for their time and the opportunity to interview with them. 

**Follow up emails**<br>If you haven’t heard back from an employer after your interview, you should send a brief follow up email one week after the interview. When possible, send this follow up as a reply to a previous email. Provide them with the basic information of when you interviewed and share with them that you’re still interested in the position. Keep it short and clear. 

**Your Email Address**<br>Recruiters and employers are constantly sending emails. Make sure you decrease their chance for error or annoyance by having an email that is simple to type. Having an email address that is just your name is very helpful.
