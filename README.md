# Welcome to your NewForce Career Prep Guide! 

This guide includes all of the steps NewForce students take to prepare them to apply for jobs in software development. Just like our classroom curriculum, we rely on feedback from our employer partners to ensure students are prepared to tackle the job search. 

This guide will be completed over your six-months at NewForce. This is a comprehensive reference packed with instructions and examples to make this process easier. 

As you will see throughout the guide, all of the included examples are from Cohort 2 student Jennifer Johnson. You will see her journey through our career prep curriculum. 

Job searching can be the worst. We’ve all been there. We repeatedly put ourselves in stressful interviews, hoping to get the job. When we don’t, it feels like instant rejection. In addition to the resources below, we will also guide you in the art of reframing your thinking when it comes to interviews and possible rejection emails. 

Most importantly, we are your biggest cheerleaders. We will be there to help you find jobs, talk you through the process as much or as little as you’d like, and be an ear for you to vent frustrations. This is ongoing support, too! Once you graduate from the program, we will still be helping you as much as you would like. 

By arming you with comprehensive career prep skills and offering you a family-like support system, our aim is to set you up for all the success.
