# Tech Resume

Let’s make a tech resume! Tech resumes include all of the same things as an average resume, plus a little extra. The focus of a tech resume is to highlight the software development skills you’ve gained through your technical experience. It’s also important to highlight previous work because most of your past experiences will be transferable to a tech career! 

You will begin building your technical resume on your own. Courtney will send you your student folder, which will have a document called Resume Text Doc. You’ll begin adding your information in this document. Trust me, you’ll want it here first so you can copy and paste it to various other places later, like LinkedIn. 

We will be scheduling one-on-ones to iron out resume details. This is the perfect time for us to help you brag about yourself, reword something you might think needs help, etc.
