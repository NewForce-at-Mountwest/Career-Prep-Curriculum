## Connect with Recruiters and Employers 

1. Did an employer visit NewForce? Connect with them on LinkedIn and send them a brief message thanking them for visiting. Pick one or two things that really stood out during their visit, and include that in the personal message. Did you have a follow up question? This would be a great time to ask! 
2. Is there someone you want to connect with like an alumni of NewForce? Connect with them and send them a personal message. You could talk about NewForce or admire where they're working or whatever makes sense to you! Open the door of communication. 
3. Uh oh. I just created my profile and someone reached out but I haven't graduated. What do I do? Regardless of what path you choose, engage in conversation ASAP! 
   1. If you're not ready to start the job search because you've not completed enough of your training, let them know you're currently in an intensive full-stack bootcamp. Give them some background on the program and what you're working on and towards. Ask them if you can reach back out once you've completed more or all of the program. Thank them for reaching out to you. 
   2. If a recruiter or employer reaches out to you by direct message but they didn't connect with you, initiate the connection. 
   3. If a recruiter or employer reaches out about an opportunity that you're interested in, get more information. Ask for a job description and then move quickly to tailor your resume for that position. It's likely they've sent dozens of messages to potential candidates, so stand out by moving swiftly. You can always reach out to Courtney who loves to help tailor resumes! 

## Additional Thoughts

1. Are You An Introvert & Does This All Sound Terrible? 
   1. You're not alone. You have the control to network at your own pace. While the above is a guideline to stay active and be seen on LinkedIn, do what makes you feel comfortable. 
2. What's the difference between self-promotion and bragging?
   1. Bragging is exaggerating your achievements. Self-promotion is stating the facts. A theme you're hear a lot while working on career prep at NewForce is credit where credit is due. If you're stating the facts about your amazing accomplishments and your strengths, you're sharing you with your network. You deserve to be seen!
