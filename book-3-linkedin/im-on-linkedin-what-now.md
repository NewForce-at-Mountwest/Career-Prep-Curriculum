Networking

1. Building Your Network
   1. Connect with your cohort
   2. Connect / reconnect with people you know
   3. Join Groups on LinkedIn
2. Staying Active 
   1. Follow software development companies you're interested in
   2. Share software development related posts
   3. Like and comment on both your connections and the companies you follow
   4. Share your capstone videos with a description of your project and what you enjoyed about building it
   5. Set aside some time to dive into LinkedIn a few times a week, more if you're job searching 
3. Connecting with Recruiters and Employers 
   1. Did an employer visit NewForce? Connect with them on LinkedIn and send them a message thanking them for visiting. Pick one or two things that really stood out during their visit, and include that in the personal message. 
   2. Is there someone you want to connect with like an alumni of NewForce? Connect with them and send them a personal message. You could talk about NewForce or admire where they're working or whatever makes sense to you! Open the door of communication. 
   3. Uh oh. I just created my profile and someone reached out but I haven't graduated. What do I do? Regardless of what path you choose, engage in conversation ASAP! 
      1. If you're not ready to start the job search because you've not completed enough of your training, let them know you're currently in an intensive full-stack bootcamp. Give them some background on the program and what you're working on and towards. Ask them if you can reach back out once you've completed more or all of the program. 
      2. If a recruiter or employer reaches out to you by direct message but they didn't connect with you, initiate the connection. 
      3. If a recruiter or employer reaches out about an opportunity that you're interested in, get more information. Ask for a job description and then move quickly to tailor your resume for that position. It's likely they've sent dozens of messages to potential candidates, so stand out by moving swiftly. You can always reach out to Courtney who loves to help tailor resumes! 
4. Are You An Introvert & Does This All Sound Terrible? 
   1. You're not alone. You have the control to network at your own pace. While the above is a guideline, do what makes you feel comfortable. 
5. What's the difference between networking and bragging about myself?
