# LinkedIn Profile

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is an online version of your resume. The biggest difference between your resume and LinkedIn is in layout and branding (more details on that below) and the summary (more details on that below) but otherwise, the language should mirror the descriptions in your resume of your experience, projects, and education. It is important for employers to see consistency between both platforms. 

For an example on LinkedIn, so you can see how all of these pieces come together, check out [Jenâ€™s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-johnson74/) profile.
