# When Should I Talk Money with an Employer?

The first time you should talk about money is after you’ve been offered a job. This is the negotiations process. If you talk about money before an offer, the company will likely feel you don’t actually want to work for them, you just want their money. Employers want to know you want to work for them, and if they really want you to join them, they’re going to negotiate a contract that works for you. We are available to help you through all aspects of job searching, including salary negotiations. Feel free to reach out to us if you need help! 

**What if they ask me for a salary range?**<br>This should adapt for every job. There’s no one answer to this. A safe number to offer up, however, is NewForce graduates’ median salary of $45,000. We are always here to help you come up with this number.
