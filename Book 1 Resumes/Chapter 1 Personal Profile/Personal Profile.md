# Personal Profile

Your personal profile will show you in a, you guessed it, personal way. When writing this statement, find a balance between your skills and why you’re passionate about what you do. Paint that picture of who you are in just a few sentences. This is your resume’s thesis! Your origin story into software development! Making it personal allows recruiters and hiring managers to become connected to you from the start. 

### Examples: 

1. Prior to NewForce, I taught high school Spanish for six years. My overarching goal as a teacher was to instill a sense of connection between my students and the cultures, peoples, and practices that otherwise seemed distant without words as a bridge. This is at the root of my lifelong fascination with learning languages: their ability to forge connections. When I began dabbling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, languages of a different sort, the learning process immediately felt familiar. As with spoken languages, it was engaging, challenging, and just plain fun. It also struck me that computer languages, too, are quite literally tools of connection, and I began to entertain the idea of a career in tech. After being accepted into and developing skills through NewForce, I am excited to pursue opportunities in this dynamic field which, like me, has language and connection at its core.
2. During my ten years working retail, I developed and nurtured a deep passion for providing experiences. A meaningful experience for customers and employees relies on clear communication and a strong behind-the-scenes process. I spent a lot of my time cultivating these behind-the-scenes processes so we could provide the company with data-based insights to improve the customer experience. I discovered I loved the investigative side of pursuing success, as well as helping to create pathways to better experiences, and I wanted to learn more. This led me to apply for NewForce. I’m looking forward to taking all of my skills and applying them to a development team where I can continue to learn as I build positive experiences for others.
3. I like to make things work. That's why I love software development: I'm really good at finding and implementing solutions. I've been developing applications for over five years. I enjoy it so much, I convinced previous employers to allow me to build useful applications even though it wasn't part of my duties. I recently completed an intensive six-month program at NewForce, where I was fully immersed in all aspects of software development. I have the base knowledge, skills and experience to contribute to a team, and I look forward to continuing to grow as a developer and help make things work.
4. My love of learning everything about technology all began at a very early age with an old Commodore 64. Over the years, with the help of numerous Google searches, I have become a self-taught individual, always teaching myself something new. I have discovered that the way that I learn best is to be challenged with projects that require me to work outside of my comfort zone and knowledge set. Software development includes its share of challenges, and I look forward to growing and learning with an innovative tech company. 
5. I remember clearly wanting to be an engineer above everything else when I was younger, but I found myself drawn to serving my community after the opioid epidemic through social services. Over time, my love of logic and simplicity crept back into my work through self-teaching, making templates, creating training modules for new employees, and eventually customizing The Underprivileged Children Foundation website into an entirely new site able to vet potential applicants and one-time or recurring payments. This allowed me to solve a number of problems and make a number of tasks easier for the foundation. This revved up my desire to pursue this field further, and I look forward to becoming a forever student in this ever changing field.

### I'm stuck. How do I find my personal profile?

Ask yourself these questions:

1. What are the top two reasons you enjoy coding?
2. What's your history with technology and what drew you to it?
3. What are the similarites between your previous work experience / career and software development?
4. What do you hope to achieve as a software developer?

After thinking through some of these questions, jot down a few thoughts or a draft in your Resume Text Doc in the Person Profile section. In your one-on-one with Courtney, the two of you can start to shape your personal profile.
