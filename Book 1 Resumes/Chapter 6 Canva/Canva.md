Canva

Canva is a drag-and-drop design site that makes resumes look professional. It takes a little getting used to, but we will have a crash-course in Canva and always be available to help. Here’s [Jen’s Canva Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEqKarUx9is0_Yawc-qwTZWvrLrk3BHh/view?usp=sharing) as an example of what your resume will eventually look like. 

We’ve developed some design templates in Canva. Feel free to use these as a starting point and then edit colors, etc. to personalize. You are not required to use these templates if you want to use another format or further design but remember -- simple is better here so avoid over the top resume designs. 

Do not put your headshot on your resume. Why? When hiring, recruiters are trained to remain bias-free, and sending a resume with a picture of you compromises this. Some companies will throw out all resumes with photos to ensure a fair hiring process. A headshot will also detract from your listed experience. If they want to know more about you, they can visit your LinkedIn profile on your resume. If that weren’t enough, headshots aren’t ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly. More on the evil ATS later. 

### Canva Resume: 

1. Create a Canva account by visiting [Canva.com](http://canva.com) 
2. Select a template
   1. [Template 1](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEUSMJyYTo/share/preview?token=g0qIuvb7OI6YGGZGPaSZgA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEUSMJyYTo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)[ ](https://www.canva.com/design/DAERoEeyhQw/share/preview?token=5JRcyOLqkJAlcKfzsaCSAA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAERoEeyhQw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
   2. [Template 2](https://www.canva.com/design/DAESqk0ANTI/share/preview?token=6Db_Tr7tkAnBtA17SAZpLQ&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAESqk0ANTI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
   3. [Template 3](https://www.canva.com/design/DAERuhfk2zU/share/preview?token=bAshcZ6o5RGWT39Z-AN4Mw&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAERuhfk2zU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
   4. [Template 4](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEVjv0Of_g/share/preview?token=ORR4aCbWHnhGAw9LDY1VgA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEVjv0Of_g&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
   5. [Template 5](https://www.canva.com/design/DAESSTooHxA/share/preview?token=XV1UL1RD2GSUS-bGmZzBQg&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAESSTooHxA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (Best for a one-page resume) 
3. Make a copy of the template by going to FILE, selecting MAKE A COPY, and renaming it 
   1. **Please do not edit one of the original templates** 
4. Send Courtney an editable link to your Canva resume
   1. This will come in handy if you need help with spacing, wording, etc. This will also allow Jordan to help with tech edits later in the semester. We won’t adjust anything without your approval. 
5. Start plugging in your information from your resume Google Doc! 
   1. Make sure to **copy and paste** so you still have your resume text in your Google Doc. You’ll want this when we move to LinkedIn.
